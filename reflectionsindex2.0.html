Here I will describe my reflections from each class. As I am creating this website at the beginning of the semester, it will be constantly updated as I attend more classes.

    <h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In our first class, we covered introductions, syllabus details, and began a project. This set the tone for all of our classes, where we spent some time in the beginning covering review and new knowledge, then progressed to a hands-on project.
    </p>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In this first class, we modeled user-focused design thinking with a bias towards additive solutions. The group that I was in decided to create a chair for "Grandpa" from the Simpsons.We split into small groups which each used large whiteboards and post-its to group ideas under how the user feels, what they do, what they say, and what they think. This step really helped me narrow into an understanding of what we might need to make, without focusing yet on the actual product. 
    </p>

<br>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Later we ranked ideas based on the user's needs by feasibility and how necessary they were to the user. Ideas that were infeasible or unnecessary were marked "unwise," and eliminated. Ideas that were pretty feasible and high on the user's needs were titled "big bets." Ideas that were super feasible but lower on the user's wish-list were "utilities." Finally, one or two ideas that were very feasible and also high priority for the user were called "no brainers." Doing this gave us a more manageable range of possibilities for our project. This led to the following step, prototyping to decide. This is when we started by using only popsicle sticks, tape, and paper clips. Then we tried again, this time using string, pipe cleaners, and rubber bands. Fluctuating materials gave us insight to what worked, what didn't, and what could work. I also gained more appreciation for cardboard, which is what we used in the next step. Cardboard is malleable, but can hold its shape. We ended up prioritizing a lift/push motion to assist the user in leaving the chair. We also included a cupholder, and a reclining function that attached to the lift/push mechanism. Materials that were used the most in this project were cardboard, tape, and string. 
    </p>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        While the prototype was in no way effective, nor was it aesthetic, it proved that certain mechanics could work. A note from the professors on this subject: 
        <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">'The prototype is not precious, but what you learn from it is.' </FONT>

    <h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In our second class, we focused on following instructions to build a 3D printer. This class explored concepts related to putting together a product following prewritten instructions. We worked in pairs of two, which increased responsibility for the project, but also allowed us to collaborate. 
    </p>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Avery and her partner worked to create a Prusa Mini+ 3D printer in ENGR 11A. To begin, they opened the box and separated the parts from the packing equipment. Large parts included the Y axis and the X/Z axis. The kit also included the charger and power supply, as well as the filament sensor. Small parts included the two allen keys and the multi-wrench. P (referring to Avery's partner) and Avery largely combined their efforts for this step. It was pretty clear as to what parts were where, although it wasn’t as clear as I may have liked as to which screws were where. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        The next step was to prep the printer. This was done by putting sticky foam on the bottom of the XZ axis, and also removing cover on the electronics box on the Y axis. This step was fairly easy and both P and Avery completed this step. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Following this step, the manual recommended assessing the locations of the connection holes. At this point, P and Avery were prepared to screw the pieces together. However, as the manual suggested not to, they did not, though some concern was expressed with how the screw might reach through from the Y axis to the XZ axis. At this point, it was necessary to move the Y axis motor cable, which worked well. However, it appeared that the cable needed further manipulation once it was connected to the XZ axis. The same applies to the LCD cable, which was also moved to prep for connection of the two main parts.
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In Phase 1 of connecting the parts, it was extremely difficult to push the motor cable through the hole. Skipping ahead to the LCD cable, this was also difficult to push through, as the casing is not pliable enough, and the LCD cable especially is too large. If I were to edit anything here, I would make the hole bigger, or create pliable flaps on either side of the hole. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In Phase 2 of connecting the parts, we did not realize that the Y axis would need to be pushed all the way to the back. This caused an issue when we overtightened the screws, causing the Y axis to become stationary in the wrong position. Avery took the lead in tightening the screws, while P worked to position everything. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        One other problem that we encountered here was tightening the longest screw. The issue was that the shaft was so long that we couldn’t properly tighten the longest screw. When sticking the allen wrench into the shaft, Avery and P had difficulty locking the end of the wrench into the screw. One way that I might resolve this would be by using a screw with the same length of threads, but a longer solid shaft. Another way to fix this might be creating an indent on the outside of the Y axis, providing a shorter hole. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        P took the lead on connecting the LCD as they were able to push the cable hand tight. There were no issues attaching the LCD, though it would be helpful for the manual to describe the proper orientation, so that it would not get in the way of the Y axis while it was calibrating. The visualization for connecting the Y axis motor cable was very helpful, though it might be furthered by ensuring the cable was coming into the wire box through the hole correctly as well. Connecting the heatbed cable and filament sensor also did not pose a problem. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Covering the electronics was a bit more challenging. In this step it was essential to have all of the wires fit through the cut-outs in the plastic cover. This required some maneuvering, as the wire protectors were pretty thick.
    </p>
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        This marks the end of the building of the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer. We also set up the spool holder and attempted to calibrate, though due to a machine entanglement and the system freezing, we were unable to start a 3D print on that day. 
    </p>

    <h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In our third class, we focused on creating the torture test 3D benchys, altering them in CAD, and then working on our websites. 
    </p>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Firstly, we spent some time reviewing best practices for creating code in Bootstrap. Then we discussed CSS, which is used for style, and w3schools. In my opinion, a sticking point that could be covered more thoroughly is connecting sublime to bootstrap. Also, inserting images can be difficult. After reviewing domain definitions and functions, we began printing.
    </p>
    </body>
<html>
    <body>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        We used Thingiverse --> 24 Thing Files to open up the benchys. A benchy is a mini tugboat that does not float, but tests the functions of the 3D printer. After creating the benchy, you can measure the actual result against the website to determine the accuracy of your printer. Our challenge was to create the benchy in as little time as possible. Originally, this print would take 1 hour and 17 minutes. I originally considered using the common ratio math to decrease the factors in the horizontal shell settings, but I abandoned this as it didn't significantly change the duration. Instead, we decreased the fill density from 15% to 7.5%, changed the fill pattern from grid to gyroid, with monotonic lines on top and bottom fill, and all these changes decreased the time to 55 minutes. However, my partner and I realized that the easiest way to decrease the duration of a build is to make it smaller. So we did! We decreased the benchy size by 50%, which brought the time down to 36 minutes. This created a nearly perfect, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> mini </FONT> benchy! Some things we did notice were excessive stringing, and zits. This is mainly caused by moist filament, as our climate is relatively humid, this is to be expected. Some things we iterated for our next print were turning on speed, increasing the nozzle temp, and turning on ooze prevention. Since printing the mini took so little time, we were also able to print a regular sized boat, with fewer strings and blobs.

    <h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In our fourth class, we got to print our own model, anything we wanted. I chose a shell pot. 
    </p>
    </h4>
    <body>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            We began with a review of the homework, delving into TinkerCAD and discussing different sites to use for designing 3D models. Next, we spent some time on Thang, which is a search engine for fair use 3D models. I had considered many different models, including a taco, jewelry, and decorative pieces, but in the end I chose the Shell Pot, because as a holder it's functional, with the purple PLA we used it was aesthetic, and it had a pattern that would look nice with the natural ridges of the print. After it was printed, we were tasked with creating a day-long print, something larger and more intricate to run for a longer period of time. I thought that I wanted to create something functional, and I really like tacos, so I chose to make a cord taco. Theoretically, it would look like a taco shell, with some flowy exterior parts for the taco filling, and a semi-cylindrical hole through the middle. 
</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Update: My print is finished! And it looks awesome. Aesthetically, using a filament with a multi-color gradient really elevated the design. The texture is an interesting prism feel, which I had not done on purpose, but I do see that the original model I uploaded for the body was prismatic. It's very stringy, but that is related to the temperature of the environment. This could be compensated for by editing the extruder temperature, but that wouldn't actually decrease the stringiness by a substantial amount, which I've seen in previous prints. The cut-out worked wonderfully, one thing that I'm not sure about is why the underneath looks so messy. 
<br>
<br>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    <FONT COLOR="#ff00ff"> Key Takeaway: Using a model you're confident with can produce great results, but there will be unexpected details here and there, which you can learn from to be even more confident in the future.</FONT>
